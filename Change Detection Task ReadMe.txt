This Change Detection task is designed to obtain different working memory capacity scores. 
This task has package initialization to communicate with SMI eye-tracking device.  
Also, there are specific events trials written to communicate with the EEG amplifier through parallel port in case it is used. 
Of course, the eye-tracking (SMI) and the EEG device should be connected in order to receive the triggers.
